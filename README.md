This is a repo for my stat45800 class in 2015.

This class has two goals:
- to make progress on a specific research problem: the development of a framework for performing
"Dynamic Statistical Comparisons" (DSCs). 
- to introduce students to the skills they need to collaborate with others on a research project.
These include version control (git and github), tools for reproducible research (knitr and make), and also social
aspects of collaboration.
