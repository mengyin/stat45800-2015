This file is for my notes of things I did or need to do. 
Mostly this is for my benefit - but if others find it helpful, that's great.

# Class Plans

* Class 1
	* arrange furniture in circle
	* introductions. Pair up and get to know your partner. Then introduce your partner to the group.
	* Introduction to the idea of a Dynamic Statistical Comparison. The Elastic Net paper as a motivating example.
	* First Goal: to work in groups to produce a DSC that reproduces the results of the Elastic Net paper.
	* Before we can do this we need some familiarity with the following tools:
		* Communication (slack)
		* Version control (git, github)
		* Reproducible research (knitr, make)
