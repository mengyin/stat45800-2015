# To Do

## Preliminaries

Here are the things each student needs to do to prepare and familiarize with the tools we need before we can make progress.
(If you need help, try posting to slack.)

* Join the slack team (send me an email with your preferred email, and I will send you an invitation)
	* Post a message to the #random channel of slack telling us your favourite film

* Get aquainted with the basic goal of a Dynamic Statistical Comparison
	* Read my [blog posts](http://stephens999.github.io/blog/) - October 1, October 2, and November 17.  


* Organize github and git
	* Sign up for an account on [github](http://www.github.com). 
		* Post your github user id on the "github" channel of slack

	* Install [git](http://git-scm.com) on your laptop/computer.
		* Read Chapter 1 (and perhaps more!) of [The Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control).	

	* Read Karl Broman's [guide to git/github](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)
	* Fork the [test repo](http://github.com/stephens999/test). Add a directory to this repo with your username, and send me a pull request.
	
 
* Organize R and Rstudio
	* Install [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com) on your laptop/computer.
	* Install the ``knitr`` package in R.
	* Read Karl Broman's [knitr in a nutshell](http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/)
 	* Use knitr to produce a report

* Organize 'make'
	* make sure you have a working version of 'make' on your computer. This should come standard with linux. With mac you will need to install xtools. 
See the second answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6767481/where-can-i-find-make-program-for-mac-os-x-lion). With Windows I don't know what the easiest approach is.  


* Organize the 'dscr' package
	* Install the [dscr package](https://github.com/stephens999/dscr) in R
